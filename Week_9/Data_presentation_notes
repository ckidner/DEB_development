“Above all else, show the data.” — Edward Tufte


“There are two goals when presenting data: convey your story and establish credibility.” — Edward Tufte


Tell the truth
Tailor presentation to the audience
Choose the right graph
Emphasise important points
Form follows function


The right chart enhances information, the wrong one conceals insights.

Omit the insignificant to highlight the essential!



NO CLUTTER!  Everythin on the chart should be there for a reason and essential to conveying the meassage.  Do you need all the tick labesls, lines etc... are the colours helping or hindering?

Titles should be informative! NOT "results of the analysis"
