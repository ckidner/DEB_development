If your function is correct, running the cell will print a message stating that the test has passed. If there is an error in your function, the code cell will produce an Assertion Error. You may also add additional code cells in this notebook to help you to debug your code, but please remove these prior to the project submission date.\n\nPlease note that you must run the cell containing your functions before running these cells. If you have made changes to a function, you must re-run that cell before running a test again to get an accurate result. ","pos":25,"state":"done","type":"cell"}
