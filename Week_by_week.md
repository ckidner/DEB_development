# Working document for what will be happening each week  


### Week 1: Introduction to biological research questions and real-world datasets.  
Short recorded lecture from each flavour lead about how data analysis is used in their field.
Outside exercise measuring tree diameters in small groups.  
Inside workshop entrying the data, summarising by group and comparing between groups.   Noteing noise and error.  
Weekly quiz  topics: error, summary, signficant differences  

### Week 2: Data entry, filtering and formatting Data entry, cleaning and summarising.  
Students will be taught best practices for entering and organising data and the coding required to manage this.  
Downloading data sets, re-shaping, finding errors.  New topics likely cleaning and re-shaping
Weekly quiz  topics: 

### Week 3: Data visualisation  
How to choose appropriate visualisations for different data types.  Coding for producing a range of plot types, for data exploration.  
Weekly quiz  

### Week 4: Inferential statistics   
Teaching the principals of testing variation between groups.  Coding to run bootstrapping tests. Describing commonly used approaches (t-tests).  Dependant variables, Linear regression
Possibly mostly a reminder of Y1 work?
Weekly quiz  
Mega quiz - coding  

### Week 5: Multivariate analysis 1.  
Introduction to the concepts of multivariate statistics.  
Can we do this without matrix algebra?  
Standardisation, co-variance, eigen values and vectors
Weekly quiz  

### Week 6: Multivariate analysis 2.  
How to visualise and interpret multivariate relationships in Python.  Using examples to provide a framework.

Weekly quiz  

### Week 7: Starting work with the datasets  
Students pick a dataset to focus on (groups of 5) and in workshops led by each flavours lead develop a hypothesis which can be tested using their data exploration skills.  
Recorded lecture on hypothesis development and testing  
3 parallel workshops to develop plans for each group finishing with short presesntation  of each group's plans  
Weekly quiz  

### Week 8: Multivariate analysis 3.
Expanding using additional examples.  (distance metrics, kmeans and hiearchical clustering?)
Recorded lecture on Multivariate analysis  
Workshop for project work  
Weekly quiz  
Mega quiz - coding  

### Week 9: Principles of data presentation  
Coding and principles for communicating data to, for example, avoid misleading or difficult to interpret figures  
Recorded lecture on data presentation, examples of good and bad practise
Workshop developing posters  
Weekly quiz  

### Week 10: Poster day  
An event for students to display and present their posters, for assessment by staff and peers.  Will be accompanied by food and drinks at the Bayes Institute.  
Poster due in  
Portfolio due in
